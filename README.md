*DURATION* :- 4 WEEKS FROM 14th JULY TO 14th AUGUST 2025
*MENTOR* :- NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR


Here's a clear summary of the **objectives, key points, and activities** for **Internship Task - 4: Generative Text Model** (as shown in your image from CODTECH):

---

## üéØ **Objective:**

To design and implement a **text generation model** capable of producing **coherent, meaningful paragraphs** based on user-provided prompts, using either **GPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) architectures.

---

## üîë **Key Points:**

1. **Model Selection**:

   * Use a **GPT-based model** (like GPT-2) for powerful pre-trained generation.
   * Alternatively, build a **custom LSTM model** using a dataset of your choice.

2. **Text Generation**:

   * Generate **relevant and grammatically correct text** in response to various user prompts.

3. **User Interaction**:

   * The model should accept **custom user input** and generate appropriate responses dynamically.

4. **Deliverable Format**:

   * Submit a **Jupyter Notebook** showing:

     * Model setup
     * Code
     * Prompt examples and generated results
     * Comments and explanations

---

## üìù **Activities to be Performed:**

### 1. **Research & Setup**

* Learn the basics of text generation models: GPT and/or LSTM.
* Install necessary libraries (e.g., `transformers`, `torch`, or `tensorflow`).

### 2. **Model Implementation**

* **Option A (Recommended)**: Use **Hugging Face GPT-2** for text generation.
* **Option B**: Build an LSTM model using `Keras` and train it on a text dataset (like movie scripts, books, etc.).

### 3. **Prompt Testing**

* Run **at least 3‚Äì5 prompt examples** through the model.
* Evaluate the **coherence, relevance, and creativity** of the output.

### 4. **Documentation**

* Add markdown cells explaining:

  * What the model does
  * How it works
  * Your findings

### 5. **Final Submission**

* A complete and clean **`.ipynb` notebook** containing:

  * Code
  * Text outputs
  * Brief explanations
  * User instructions
